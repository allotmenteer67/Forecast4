// tracking kept failing on real hardware despite checking out fine in
// every test that could actually be run against this code (no browser
// access here — see the session's own back-and-forth on this). Rather
// than keep patching that approach, this now leans on the one thing
// already proven reliable elsewhere in this exact app: every OTHER
// headline cell opens its sheet with a plain "click" listener and none
// of them have ever needed a swipe/tap fix. Pointer tracking here is
// now used for ONLY ONE thing — detecting a genuine swipe — and a
// completed swipe sets a flag to swallow the click event that follows
// it (both fire from the same gesture); everything else just falls
// through to the native click, letting the browser's own tap-vs-drag
// disambiguation do the job instead of a hand-rolled threshold.
//
// This used to live on tideRow alone, so a swipe only worked if it
// started on the tide card — starting on fishing did nothing, which is
// exactly why the place-dot icons existed as a separate way to switch
// location from that side. Attaching this to the whole pair instead
// means either card can be swiped, and the dots aren't needed any more.
// tideFishingSwiped is a plain top-level `let`, not scoped inside this
// block, because fishingRow's own "click" listener (in fishing-ui.js,
// loaded after this file, sharing the same global script scope) needs
// to read and clear the exact same flag a gesture that started on this
