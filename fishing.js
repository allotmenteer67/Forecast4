// own comment for the specific reasoning, and Help for the plain-English
// version. The scoring deliberately leans harder on the factors with
// real physical backing (wind, wave/swell — you can directly observe
// these) than on the ones that are closer to angling folklore (pressure
// trend, tidal-range/"moon phase" strength) — see FISHING_WEIGHTS below.
