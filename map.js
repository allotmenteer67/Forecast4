//
// WHAT THIS MAP IS, AND ISN'T
//
// It is drawn from the same merged global models the headline figures
// use, at roughly 10 km spacing. It is deliberately NOT built on UKMO's
// 2 km UKV model, despite that being far higher resolution, for three
// reasons worth recording because the temptation to "upgrade" it later
// will be strong:
//
//   1. UKMO open data carries an additional 4-hour delay on top of the
//      normal run cycle (Open-Meteo say so themselves, and add that it
//      makes the forecast less accurate as a result). Four hours is
//      useless for "should I hang the washing out".
//   2. UKV is not one of the app's six sources, so a UKV map could not
//      be FFV-corrected at all. It would be raw, uncorrected model
//      output drawn immediately above bias-corrected headline numbers,
//      and the two would visibly disagree.
//   3. Sampling finer than the model's own grid adds no information.
//      At 9-25 km native resolution, a 10 km grid is already at the
//      limit of what the data actually contains.
//
// So this map answers "where is the rain and which way is it moving",
// not "will it rain here in twenty minutes". The hourly slider on the
// front page remains the better answer to the second question.

// each render actually took. Confirmed on-device as the actual cause
// of Play showing 2-3 hour "jumps" with Pressure and Temperature
// switched on: those two are genuinely the most expensive layers
// (isobars are marching-squares contour tracing; temperature is a
// full-canvas gradient fill), and once a single renderMap() call takes
// longer than 700ms, the fixed timer is already overdue the instant it
// finishes — so the next tick fires almost immediately and does its
// own long render, and so on. Each tick's own code only ever adds
// exactly 1 hour; nothing here was skipping steps. What was happening
// is the BROWSER only gets an idle moment to actually paint a frame to
// the screen occasionally in between, so several genuine +1 increments
// could happen invisibly while the screen was still showing the last
// one it managed to paint — reading as a multi-hour jump that wasn't
// really there in the data, only in what got displayed.
//
// Self-scheduling setTimeout instead: the next step is only ever
// queued once the current render has actually finished, so the update
// rate can never outrun what the device can actually draw and paint.
// Rain-only still plays at roughly the original pace, since a render
// that finishes well under 700ms just waits out the rest of it as
// before. With Pressure and Temperature on, the honest trade is that
// each step now genuinely takes as long as it takes — slower in real
// seconds when the layers are heavy — rather than silently skipping
// hours to keep pretending it can hit a fixed cadence it can't sustain.
