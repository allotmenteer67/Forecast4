// aviation.js — genuinely observed (not modelled) cloud cover from the
// nearest UK METAR-reporting airport, decoded into the same
// cloudLow/cloudMid/cloudHigh % shape the rest of the app already uses.
//
// Why this exists: app.js's "Actual" cloud figures (cloudLow_mean etc.,
// see averageCloudByDay) come from Open-Meteo's hourly reanalysis —
// itself a model output, not a human/sensor observation. METAR reports
// are actual aerodrome observations (oktas of cloud at a reported
// height, taken every 20-60 min), so this is a genuine independent
// ground-truth check on that figure, not just another forecaster.
// Scoped as a data-fetch/decode module only, same division of labour
// as tide.js vs tide-ui.js — wiring this into the Actual row / a
// display card is the next session's work, not this file's.
//
// Data source: aviationweather.gov's public METAR API — free, no key.
// Relayed through a small Cloudflare Worker (aviation-proxy-worker.js,
// same pattern as admiralty-proxy-worker.js) because several reports
// say aviationweather.gov doesn't send CORS headers, which blocks a
// direct browser fetch even though the API itself needs no auth.
//
// NOTE: this file was written without live network access to verify
// aviationweather.gov's exact current response shape, so the parsing
// below deliberately works from the raw METAR text (rawOb) rather than
// trusting specific JSON field names — the raw METAR format is a
// stable, decades-old international standard, so that's the safer
// thing to depend on. Worth a real test against a live response before
// relying on this.

// A working subset of UK METAR stations, not exhaustive. Picked for
// reasonable geographic spread (every English region, Wales, Scotland
// incl. islands, Northern Ireland) rather than completeness — same
// "good enough coverage, extend later" approach as EA_TIDE_STATIONS.
// Add more rows as gaps in coverage show up in practice.
